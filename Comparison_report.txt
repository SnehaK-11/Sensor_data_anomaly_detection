ANOMALY DETECTION SUMMARY
Total Records: 1000

Z-Score Method (Statistical)
The Z-Score approach gave Precision 1.00, Recall 0.64, and F1-Score 0.78 with very low execution time 0.000230 seconds. It is simple and easy to understand, but it missed some spikes and drops because it depends on a fixed statistical threshold.

Isolation Forest (Machine Learning)
Isolation Forest produced Precision 0.86, Recall 0.86, and F1-Score 0.86 with execution time 0.337326 seconds. This method detected unusual and complex patterns better and provided balanced results.

Method Comparison

Detection Quality: Isolation Forest better (F1 0.86 > 0.78)

Speed: Z-Score much faster

Confidence Scoring: available in Isolation Forest

Interpretability: Z-Score easier

Final Conclusion
Isolation Forest is more reliable for accurate anomaly detection, while Z-Score is suitable for quick real-time alerts. A hybrid use of both methods is recommended for effective sensor monitoring.
