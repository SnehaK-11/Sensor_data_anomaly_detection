# Sensor_data_anomaly_detection
For this project, I built an anomaly detection system for sensor data streams. I first created a synthetic dataset using sensor_data_generator.py, which includes normal sensor readings as well as anomalies like spikes, drops, and unusual patterns. Then, I implemented two methods to detect anomalies: a statistical method using Z-Score and a machine learning method using Isolation Forest, through anomaly_detection.py. For each detected anomaly, I logged the timestamp, sensor values, and confidence score in anomaly_results.csv. I also compared the two methods based on precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time in comparison_report.txt. I found that Z-Score is very fast and simple, but it can miss some anomalies, while Isolation Forest detects anomalies more accurately but takes slightly longer. Overall, I recommend using both methods together for efficient and reliable anomaly detection. I used Python along with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib for this project.
